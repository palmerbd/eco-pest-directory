## BDD Server (BallroomDance2) — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | Hetzner Cloud |
| Server name | BallroomDance2 |
| IP | 178.156.197.177 |
| **SSH port** | **2222** (changed from 22 during hardening — Task #25) |
| SSH user | root |
| SSH key | Ed25519 key, comment: `dance-directory-agent` |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| WP root | `/var/www/ballroomdancedirectory` |

**Port 22 is CLOSED. Always use port 2222.**

---

## SSH Key Location

The SSH private key lives in the sandbox at:
```
~/.ssh/dance_directory_key
/sessions/great-hopeful-einstein/.ssh/dance_directory_key
```

**Important:** The sandbox CANNOT reach the server via SSH directly — outbound SSH from the Linux VM is blocked by network routing. You must run SSH through Desktop Commander (Don's Windows machine) or via Node.js `ssh2`.

---

## SSH From Don's Windows Machine (Desktop Commander)

This is the working pattern for SSH from Cowork sessions.

### Step 1 — Write the key to Don's machine

```javascript
// Via Desktop Commander write_file
mcp__Desktop_Commander__write_file({
  path: "C:\\Users\\fxtra\\.ssh\\dance_directory_key",
  content: "<contents of ~/.ssh/dance_directory_key>"
})
```

### Step 2 — Fix key permissions (Windows SSH requires strict permissions)

```batch
icacls "C:\Users\fxtra\.ssh\dance_directory_key" /inheritance:r /grant:r "%USERNAME%:R"
```

### Step 3 — SSH via bat file

```batch
@echo off
set KEY=C:\Users\fxtra\.ssh\dance_directory_key
set PORT=2222
set SERVER=root@178.156.197.177

ssh -i "%KEY%" -p %PORT% -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no %SERVER% "your-command-here" 2>&1
```

Run it: `cmd /c C:\Users\fxtra\your-bat-file.bat` via `mcp__Desktop_Commander__start_process`

### Step 4 — SCP a file to the server

```batch
scp -i "%KEY%" -P 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no "C:\local\file.php" "root@178.156.197.177:/remote/path/"
```

**Note: `scp` uses `-P` (capital P) for port, unlike `ssh` which uses `-p`.**

---

## SSH Via Node.js ssh2 (Alternative)

If bat file SSH isn't working, use Node.js `ssh2` package. This is more reliable for capturing output.

### Install ssh2 (first time only)

```javascript
// Write and run via Desktop Commander
execSync('"C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.cmd" install ssh2 --prefix C:\\Users\\fxtra\\node_modules_global')
```

### SSH script template

```javascript
const { Client } = require('C:\\Users\\fxtra\\node_modules_global\\node_modules\\ssh2');
const fs = require('fs');

const conn = new Client();
conn.connect({
  host: '178.156.197.177',
  port: 2222,
  username: 'root',
  privateKey: fs.readFileSync('C:\\Users\\fxtra\\.ssh\\dance_directory_key'),
});

await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  conn.on('ready', resolve);
  conn.on('error', reject);
});

// Run a command
conn.exec('ls /var/www/ballroomdancedirectory/wp-content/mu-plugins/', (err, stream) => {
  let out = '';
  stream.on('data', d => out += d);
  stream.on('close', () => { console.log(out); conn.end(); });
});
```

## Known Issue: SSH Key Mismatch After Server Migration

The BallroomDance2 server (178.156.197.177) was rebuilt after the ranbyus trojan infection in May 2026.
The SSH key in `~/.ssh/dance_directory_key` is the key that was generated for that new server — but it
was added to the server's `authorized_keys` via Hetzner console during the migration, not by a Cowork session.

If you get `All configured authentication methods failed`:
- The key in the sandbox may not match what's in the server's `authorized_keys`
- Fix: Log into Hetzner console → BallroomDance2 → Access → Add SSH key, paste the PUBLIC key from `~/.ssh/dance_directory_key.pub`

## WP Admin Access (No SSH Required)

For many server tasks, WP Admin + Theme Editor is faster than SSH.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| WP Admin URL | https://wp.greenpestdirectory.com/wp-admin |
| Username | danceadmin |
| Password | DanceAdmin2026!BDD |
| Theme Editor | WP Admin → Tools → Theme File Editor |
| Plugin Editor | WP Admin → Tools → Plugin File Editor |
| Must-Use Plugins | WP Admin → Plugins → Must-Use |

## How the mu-plugin Was Deployed (2026-05-28)

**Goal:** Move `wp_is_application_passwords_available` filter from `functions.php` to a
must-use plugin so it survives theme changes.

**Why SSH failed:** SSH port was 2222 (not 22), and the sandbox VM can't make outbound SSH connections.
Node.js ssh2 auth also failed — key mismatch (key may not have been in new server's authorized_keys).

**Method used:** Theme Editor bootstrap pattern.

1. Opened WP Admin → Tools → Theme File Editor → functions.php
2. Used Chrome MCP JavaScript tool to inject a bootstrap block into CodeMirror:
   ```php
   // One-time: write mu-plugin if it doesn't exist yet
   if ( ! file_exists( WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/mu-plugins/bdd-app-passwords.php' ) ) {
       $muDir = WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/mu-plugins';
       if ( ! file_exists( $muDir ) ) { mkdir( $muDir, 0755, true ); }
       file_put_contents( $muDir . '/bdd-app-passwords.php', '<?php ... add_filter(...) ...' );
   }
   ```
3. Saved functions.php via the hidden submit button
4. Triggered execution by loading `https://wp.greenpestdirectory.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pest_company?per_page=1`
5. Verified at WP Admin → Plugins → Must-Use: **"BDD Application Passwords Enable"** appeared ✅
6. Removed the bootstrap block from functions.php (cleanup)

**Result:** `/wp-content/mu-plugins/bdd-app-passwords.php` exists on server with the filter.
This file survives theme changes, theme updates, and theme switches — it is NOT tied to functions.php.

---

## Current State of functions.php (after cleanup)

```php
<?php
// KITT JWT auth — added 2026-05-28 via wp-admin file editor
if (!defined('JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY')) define('JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY', '6f2d3cb...');
if (!defined('JWT_AUTH_CORS_ENABLE')) define('JWT_AUTH_CORS_ENABLE', true);

// KITT — extend JWT lifetime to 1 year
add_filter('jwt_auth_expire', function() { return time() + (60 * 60 * 24 * 365); });

// KITT — restore WP application passwords at runtime (priority 999 wins over Wordfence)
add_filter('wp_is_application_passwords_available', '__return_true', 999);

// [rest is standard Twenty Twenty-Five theme code]
```

The `wp_is_application_passwords_available` filter exists in BOTH places:
- `functions.php` (priority 999, active now)
- `mu-plugins/bdd-app-passwords.php` (permanent fallback, loads before themes)

Both are intentional. If the theme changes, the mu-plugin carries the filter forward.

---

## Deploying mu-plugins to Future Directory Servers

For new directories (eco-pest, etc.), the same pattern applies:

**Option A — SSH (fastest, if key is in server's authorized_keys):**
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/dance_directory_key -p 2222 root@[NEW_SERVER_IP] \
  "mkdir -p /var/www/[niche]directory/wp-content/mu-plugins && \
   cat > /var/www/[niche]directory/wp-content/mu-plugins/bdd-app-passwords.php << 'EOF'
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: Application Passwords Enable
 */
add_filter('wp_is_application_passwords_available', '__return_true');
EOF"
```

**Option B — Theme Editor bootstrap (if SSH unavailable):**
Follow the same steps as the 2026-05-28 BDD deployment above.

**Option C — WP-CLI (if on the server already):**
```bash
wp --path=/var/www/[niche]directory mu-plugin list --allow-root
```
