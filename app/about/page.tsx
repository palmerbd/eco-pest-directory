            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Green Pest Control Directory is an independent, third-party online directory. We are not
              affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any pest control company franchise or brand
              listed on this site. We are not operated by Arthur Murray, Fred Astaire Pest Control Companies,
              Dance With Me Studios, or any other franchise organization.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              We are a consumer resource — built to make it easier for people to discover private
              dance instruction studios in their area, compare options, and connect with the studio
              that is right for them.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Studio listings on this directory are compiled from publicly available sources,
              including Google Maps, state business registration databases, and direct outreach to
              individual studios. Basic factual information &mdash; studio name, address, phone number,
              hours of operation, and dance styles offered &mdash; is collected and displayed for each
              listing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              All studio descriptions on this directory are original content written by our editorial
              team. We do not reproduce or adapt any text, photographs, or marketing materials from
              studio websites or franchise corporate sites.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Listings are marked as <strong>Unclaimed</strong> until a verified studio owner or
              authorized representative claims their profile. We encourage studio owners to claim
              their listing to ensure their information is accurate and up to date.

              We make reasonable efforts to ensure listing information is accurate, but studio hours,
              pricing, offerings, and contact details can change. Always contact a studio directly to
              confirm current information before visiting.
